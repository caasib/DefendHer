# DefendHer
This is a website which acts as a platform for multiple self-defense courses and modules. Users can sign up and do a quick questionnaire which assesses their skill level and the right course for them, and then they can learn from the course modules and do a quick quiz for understanding at the end. Users can also think about different ways to approach certain scenarios by giving answers to an AI chatbot, which will give feedback about how good their approach is and what they can do differently.
# How we built it
We built the front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and the back-end was Python using the Flask library. To track and store user progress we implemented a JSON database.
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was all of our first times touching front-end development, so we're happy we were able to make so much progress. In the InnovateHer Hackathon at Purdue University-Main Campus, the first largest female centric hackathon, we won first place for the Safety Category and second place in the overall competition out of 24 teams!
# What we learned
We learned a lot about front-end and back-end development, and how to incorporate multiple programming languages into one product.
